# Interfaces (Pi ↔ MCU ↔ Drivers)

This folder defines:
- Pi ↔ MCU serial protocol (CMDVEL, ODOM, HEARTBEAT)
- Motor driver wiring (Sabertooth 2x25 mode + safety)
- Encoder wiring conventions (A/B channels + power)
- Connector pinouts (JST, screw terminals, etc.)

Status: draft; finalize during M3.
