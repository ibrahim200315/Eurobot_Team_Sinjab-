# Power architecture

## Rails (current documentation baseline)
- High-power rail: 12V (nominal 11.1–12.8V) for traction and power components
- Logic rail: 5V for Raspberry Pi, Arduino/MCU, sensors/servos via UBEC

See: `Nominal_voltages_of_components.pdf` for component-by-component voltage roles and estimated peak current / power.
