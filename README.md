## Team Identity — Sinjab 🐿️
**Sinjab** (Arabic: **سِنْجَاب**) means **squirrel**, which aligns with Eurobot 2026’s theme (squirrels, hazelnuts, nests).
We’ll keep our tone friendly-but-precise and our engineering choices simple and reliable.

### What we focus on first (next 3 months)
- **Programming + Mechanical** in **simulation first** (electronics arrive later).
- Build: field world, nav, basic perception, simple crate handling logic, safe end-in-nest behavior.

### How we work
- `main` is protected. Small branches: `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`.
- Every change via pull request + a short demo (video or rosbag) when it affects behavior.

## Documentation
- [System Requirements v0.1](docs/requirements/README.md)
- [SINJAB Design (PDF + summary)](docs/design/README.md)
- [Project Handbook v0.1](docs/handbook/README.md)
- [Design (Mechanical)](docs/design/README.md)
- [Navigation & Mission](docs/navigation/README.md)
- [Perception](docs/perception/README.md)
- [Electronics & BOM](docs/bom/README.md)

## Electronics Architecture
The SINJAB robot uses a **24V LiFePO₄ battery** with staged conversion:
- 24V → motors
- 24V → 12V → 5V → logic

All electronics documentation, BOM, and schematics are available in:
[`/electronics`](electronics/)


# Eurobot 2026 - Master Advanced Mechatronics

This is the official baseline repository for the International Challenge of the Master Advanced Mechatronics at Polytech Annecy-Chambéry.

<p style="text-align:center"> &#9888; This project must be run as a Dev Container &#9888; </p>

This year, PROJ703 and PROJ903 have the goal of tackling the challenge set for the Eurobot Contest 2026 (see the [Official Website](https://www.eurobot.org/eurobot-contest/eurobot-2026/)).

> *Winter is coming, and it’s time for the squirrels to stock up on hazelnuts so they can spend the whole winter in their soft, warm nests.</br> 
> But evil humans already took them all, put them in crates and are about to leave with them, and it will let squirrels starving for the next months!</br>
> Luckily it’s coffee time for the humans, and the squirrels have only few seconds to grab the hazelnut crates and hide it from the evil humans.</br>
> But will they have enough to pass the winter?*
>
> *Your strategies will be:*
> - *Let’s keep the hazelnuts warm.*
> - *To find is to keep!*
> - *Not too warm, not too cold.*
> - *Nest, sweet nest.*
> - *Lunch time!*
